# Serenade

## Code with voice

With Serenade, you can write code by speaking rather than typing. Code using natural voice commands like "add function hello" or "delete argument url" rather than memorizing language syntax and keyboard shortcuts. Control your editor and workflows with just your voice, and supercharge your productivity.

## Getting Started

Check out the [Serenade documentation](https://serenade.ai/learn) to learn how to set up and start using Serenade.

### Code hands-free

Debug code, read documentation, and browse the web using only your voice—all while leaning back in your chair, stretching, or petting your dog.

### Rest your wrists

Using a keyboard all day can cause wrist pain—whether you have an injury or you’re looking to prevent one, Serenade can help you be just as productive without typing at all.

### Develop using natural speech

Use commands like "add method init" and "add enum colors" to quickly and naturally build code without worrying about the spacing and syntax.

### Stop memorizing shortcuts

Refactor code by just saying "cut first function" or "delete third argument". There's no need to memorize esoteric shortcuts.

### Control any platform

With commands like focus terminal, next tab, and type hello, add voice control to any app across Mac, Windows, and Linux.

### Integrate voice into your workflow

Serenade fully supports Atom and Visual Studio Code via native plugins, with support for more editors coming soon.

### Implement custom automations

Use the Serenade API to automate any workflow, from compiling code to running tests.

### Work across multiple languages

Use the same voice commands to write Java, Python, JavaScript, TypeScript, HTML, and CSS.
